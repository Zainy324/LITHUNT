# 2022 LitHunt 
## Working
There will be 6-7 participants in each team. The treasure hunt will have
approx. 7-8 clues.

1 clue will be provided to everyone at the beginning of the game. At the
same time, one participant in each team will be informed that they are the
imposter. The imposterâ€™s task is to sabotage the game and stall as long as
possible without being caught.

Subsequent clues will be found at the right locations through QR codes.
QR codes will be placed around the correct location and scanning them will
lead to finding out the next clue.

3-4 voting rounds will be conducted at specified common locations. All
participants in a team have to vote out a probable imposter.

For the last location, the imposter will be given a different (wrong) location
than the rest of the team. The imposter's job is to make sure that the team
reaches his/her location rather than the correct one.

### Winning:
The first 2-3 teams to reach the correct last location, wins. Everyone
present at the last location, except the imposter(if still in the game), will be
rewarded.
The first 2-3 teams that reach the impostor's location, obviously with the
imposter, leads to the imposter being victorious.
